        <h1>8 &mdash; An Open Letter to 13 Year Old Me [Repost] 9/16/21:</h1>

<p>This post is titled article number 8 because it was the eighth blog post idea I came up with since starting this blog. Posts 3 through 7 though written, are still not complete by my standards and will be published some time in the future. Also note the dates I put under the title are the exact times I start writing a blog post.</p>

<p>This post is actually a post I&rsquo;d written from one of my previous private blogs. It is one of my favorite entries from there, so please enjoy.</p>

<p>When you talk with most 17 year old seniors in high school, they&rsquo;d scoff at the possibility that a 13 year old could proffer any useful life views or advice to them. After all, what does the limited paradigm of a middle schooler who hasn&rsquo;t endured the grueling nature of high school have to tell about how to survive life and all its future challenges?</p>

<p>I too, had the same attitude towards 13 year olds prior to May 14th, 2021. That day, I received an envelope from myself I had written four years earlier in 8th grade. Back then, our English teacher assigned for us to write a letter to our future selves right when we were to graduate high school.</p>

<p>Upon seeing the letter I&rsquo;d written so long ago, I felt both a twinge of &ldquo;damn four years passed already&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to read a bunch of cringeworthy content from an immature 13 year old&rdquo;. I had long forgotten what I wrote, but my gut feeling told me nothing too significant would be in it. Perhaps I&rsquo;d have a good laugh about what silly insignificant thoughts I had four years ago.</p>

<p>No. No. No&#8230; That&rsquo;s nowhere close to what ensued.</p>

<p>As expected, the letter&rsquo;s prose was quite terrible and grammatical errors were littered all over (tell tale signs of something cobbled together last minute by an eighth grader). Yet the subtext and central theme punched my heart. Reading the hastily scribbled handwriting, I was dumbfounded by how eighth grade Will wrote in fear of the future gpa grind and extreme SAT studying. 13 year old Will knew of future cutthroat math and science competitions, and how superficial their awards were, and of how they&rsquo;d wreck my future motivation to genuinely cultivate learning for science.</p>

<p>How much I&rsquo;d forgotten from that time, I thought to myself as I continued to read. A realization that high school had erased the childhood curiosity and wonder that came with learning washed over me, and the reason for my burn out and disenchantment with school became obvious. Since junior year, I&rsquo;d been spending substantial time attempting to find motivation to discover something I could dedicate my life to, but no avail came from my efforts. Yet here, upon reading my letter, I reminisced on the long hours spent after school with friends in the math room, tackling intriguing challenge problems and laughing away with Fink. It was this community and cultivation of learning erased by high school&rsquo;s mechanistic teaching style that I so dearly missed. I forgot learning could even happen through such avenues as high school instilled a mentality of finish tedious homework problems fast don&rsquo;t explore. Thank you, 13 year old me, for helping me remember there is another way.</p>

<p>Yet, sly little eighth grade Will wasn&rsquo;t finished just yet. At the end of the letter, he wrote &ldquo;if you truly think like I do now, you will find the second letter I&rsquo;ve written for you, which contains what is really really important. You&rsquo;ll need to search with your heart, not with your mind or logic or brute force, but I repeat with your heart.&rdquo; So the classic &ldquo;heart&rdquo; line pulled from the Little Prince, I thought to myself as questions raced through my head. Obviously, where is the letter and does it still exist? What&rsquo;s written in it? At the back of my mind I knew subtly the letter existed, yet I couldn&rsquo;t come to believe it did weirdly as it felt so distant and I couldn&rsquo;t recall its origins (a strange moment of cognitive dissonance indeed).</p>

<p>Nearly a month has passed, and I&rsquo;ve had no luck in finding anything. I dug up contents of old drawers, closets, and even the inside covers of books. Nothing.</p>

<p>Frustrating, yes. But I can&rsquo;t help to feel deceived, that the line &ldquo;search with your heart&rdquo; meant there was no physical second letter to begin with, that I was supposed to conceptualize myself now what 13 year old me would think. I&rsquo;ve since given up searching for a physical letter, and with the above realization in mind, I started applying an eighth grader&rsquo;s lens to my current life goals. The results have been quite surprising, and I&rsquo;ll be sure to write about those some other time.</p>
