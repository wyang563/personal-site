                <h1>2 &mdash; My Regrets as a New Adult 7/11/21:</h1>
                </div>
                <p>Largely, the realization that I&rsquo;m now an adult has not washed over me. Of course, there have been obvious changes: signing my own legal documents, getting spammed with credit card ads, and not being required to take driving classes prior to the driving test.</p>
                <p>Yet, the most significant shift I&rsquo;ve experienced these past two weeks since has been the onslaught of nostalgia and retrospection about childhood. It&rsquo;s almost melancholic to realize that I&rsquo;ll never technically be a child again and that a massive chapter of my life many adults look back as a &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; has now closed for me as well. But alas, wallowing in childhood memories and nostalgia deserve their own blog posts.</p>
                <p>Despite all the great memories, boy, there are many many things I should&rsquo;ve done better in retrospect. Childhood is the most formative period in developing one&rsquo;s personality, habits, skills, and basically any other attribute that will define me in the future. It&rsquo;s honestly disheartening to reflect on how much time I wasted as an elementary-schooler for instance when my brain was at its most neuroplastic. I could&rsquo;ve learned to speak a new language fluently or picked up a myriad of other skills that could&rsquo;ve benefited me today, but ultimately that time was squandered by my desire to play Minecraft with friends or watch random YouTube videos.</p>
                <p>And as my free time to explore and learn on my own continues to diminish now in the adult world, I&rsquo;ll regret not cultivating the following hobbies and skills deeply as a kid.</p>
                <p><strong>1 &mdash; Forgetting Chinese</strong></p>
                <p>Every time I talk with my grandpa over text, he roasts me. Sounds harsh right? Well, some context is needed perhaps.</p>
                <p>To some degree, my getting roasted is justified. My grandpa does not know English, so my texts to him are all written in Chinese, a one way street to misunderstandings and disaster. My Chinese now is to put it mildly, subpar. Like most other immigrant family kids, as high school rolled around I simply had less time to practice using my home language. As a result, I may have forgotten Chinese grammar and vocabulary to the point where my grandpa thinks I have the writing skills of a fourth grader.</p>
                <p>My regrets go far beyond that though, and that is because of grandma.</p>
                <p>Grandma used to be a Chinese literature teacher who kept a large bookshelf of renowned pieces of Chinese literature and poetry. Throughout elementary school, she was the principle reason my Chinese was halfway decent. Every day over summer breaks in elementary school, she&rsquo;d read me famous pieces like Journey to the West or San Guo Yan Yi. She&rsquo;d reminisce on the way reading poetry and novels helped her endure grueling periods of time while growing up impoverished in a farming village.</p>
                <p>Grandma passed away almost a decade ago now, and so not surprisingly subsequently my Chinese skills declined greatly afterwards. My bedroom now is my Grandma&rsquo;s old one, and the same book shelf full of Chinese poetry and literature still stares at me with disappointment every day, collecting dust.</p>
                <p><strong>2 &mdash; Piano</strong></p>
                <p>I abhorred practicing piano in eighth grade; it was the routine of the day I tried to finish as quickly as possible. Chopin? Mozart? Those triplet notes? Screw those! I was so sure of my path in life in eighth grade, become an awesome computer scientist who built cool new products while doing niche math research on the side. Piano was only a roadblock imposed by my parents&rsquo; to keep me from reaching my true potential.</p>
                <p>An eighth grader believing they know their path in life is incredibly naive and stupid, and as it turns out so was my willingness to throw out playing piano.</p>
                <p>Home alone one day in tenth grade, after not having touched the piano in a year, I spontaneously decided to return to the keyboard in the living room. Brushing off the dust from the keys, I turned on a G blues jazz backing track and decided to give improvisation a try.</p>
                <p>I hate to admit it, but I had so much fun those 30 minutes, exponentially more than I had in middle school playing piano. I&rsquo;m sure my improvs were terrible, but the spontaneous playing of notes and chords that sort of made coherent sounds was just something exhilarating I hadn&rsquo;t felt on a level in any other activity I&rsquo;ve done. To think I had missed out on such a feeling that came from playing piano after solely practicing classic pieces for 6 years was disappointing, but at least I&rsquo;d discovered this awesome part of playing piano.</p>
                <p>I gave up on piano a second time. This time because sophomore year asserted itself and forced me to focus on remedying my bio and world history grades. Again, the piano collected dust for another two years, and today I&rsquo;ve too afraid to touch it again given how I pretty much forgot everything about music theory and the physical act of piano playing.</p>
