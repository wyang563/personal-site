        <h1>13 &mdash; The Past in a Dark Alley Way</h1>
        <p>Preface: I did a quick free write today. Enjoy.</p>

<p>It was so peaceful. That ebony wooden door of yours closing one final time with a quiet click. So unassuming, so unnoticeable to the people passing by peacefully on the sidewalk. The laughter of kids and the chatter of their parents from the park across the street filled the air, yet those sounds just floated around me like a distant fog, as if my body repelled anything jovial.</p>

<p>Where do I start? Pondering is always a good escape from a brutal reality, isn&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s what you whispered in my ear the time we were sitting together on the dusty wooden park bench just outside of our favorite ice cream alley stall. I still remember that warm smile of yours, looking towards the oak tree towering on the other side of the street blooming with flowers. You always stared at that specific one, marveling at something I could not discern under its tall canopy. Maybe you were pondering a new short story to write, or maybe you just found peace in the breeze rustling the leaves high up.</p>

<p>Your absence still drifted in my head as I tread past the alleyway sandwiched between the blocks we used to live in. My steps slowed as I approached it, and by instinct I turned to see what remained of it.</p>

<p>Nothing much, I presumed, given what happened a few years ago.</p>

<p>So what drew me into that narrow space again carved between a pair of moldy brick buildings? I cannot know. You called to me perhaps? Or I probably just misheard, but you&rsquo;d forgive me, just like you have countless times before.</p>

<p>Ah, the air in the quiet alley was colder than usual. The atmosphere dead. Silence enveloped me as I stared at the empty wooden stalls with the weathered rotting remains of whatever miscellaneous items used to be sold there.</p>

<p>What made a place like this so special? Was it the young saplings now sprouting from the ruins of the cobblestone along the destroyed walls. It can&rsquo;t be that; it was the people I used to see. The poor and wealthy, artists and scientists, all together in one place in a cloud of peaceful chatter. The sound of excited news being shared of a new engaged couple with the background music of someone playing away on the public piano.</p>

<p>And suddenly I began seeing the past unfold in front of me. People reappeared moving in the market. The lovely sound of the alley filled the air.</p>

<p>There you are! I swear it was you with your dirty unkempt hair sitting at the leftmost stall. You&rsquo;re selling the little wooden trinkets you carved just an hour ago with me, staring intently with those eyes at the surrounding alley. You&rsquo;re waving, and reflexively I wave back, but merely a blink passes, and you&rsquo;ve vanished, along with the other memories of loud chatter along the stalls of the alleyway. Of the creaking sound of fruit being placed on scales as people shopped, of the crackling of tape being wrapped onto boxes, the sign a deal had just been closed.</p>

<p>When did it all go wrong? Was it when I told you to work an extra hour of my shift at the fresh spices stall because I was feeling &ldquo;sick&rdquo;. Gosh, I should&rsquo;ve never left. I should&rsquo;ve been there with you when it happened. I should&rsquo;ve waited at the stall telling jokes with you while appreciating the big oak tree outside the ice cream shop. I should&rsquo;ve endured that blast with you as it ripped through the alleyway turning it and everyone into an inferno.</p>

<p>But that locked ebony door of yours is not going to open again, and so I must say goodbye.</p>
