# Vector College Planning

Note the deployed code is in the new_deploy branch.

As for external libraries that need to be cited. We used React, and in addition used NPM real time clock for the clock timer on the Profile Page (https://www.npmjs.com/package/clock). Finally, we used a real time ToDo List library that took input values and posted them on screen (https://www.npmjs.com/package/todo-list).
